# yet-another-repository

This repoistory is the for the sole purpose of storing GML code my reference between projects, to simplify the workflow.
Reusing existing code that already works within certain parameters, will speed up my development.

*GML is only for use with the program "Game Maker Studio", and doesn't function elsewhere.
